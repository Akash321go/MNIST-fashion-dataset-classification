# Introduction

Zalando,	 a	 fashion	 and	 technology	 company	 with	 a	 large	 presence	 in	 Dublin,	 have	
released	 MNIST	 Fashion,	 an	 alternative	 to	 the	 famous	 MNIST	 hand	 written	 digit	
classification	 dataset.	 The	 dataset	 contains	 70,000	 28x28	 pixel	 grayscale	 images	 of	
fashion	items	 of	 10	 different	 kinds:	(0)	T-shirt/top,	 (1) Trouser,	(2) Pullover,	(3) Dress,	(4)
Coat,	(5) Sandal,	(6) Shirt,	(7) Sneaker,	(8) Bag,	and	9)	Ankle	boot. The	task	associated	with	this	is	
to	build	a	classification	model	that	can	recognise	these	different	fashion	items.
